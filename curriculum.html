    <li><p>SC.912.L.18.12 Discuss the special properties of water that contribute to Earth's suitability as an environment for life: cohesive behavior, ability to moderate temperature, expansion upon freezing, and versatility as a solvent.</p>
    <li><p>SC.912.N.1.1 Define a problem based on a specific  body of knowledge, for example: biology, chemistry, physics, and earth/space science, and do the following:  Pose questions about the natural world, (Articulate the purpose of the investigation and identify the relevant scientific concepts). Conduct systematic observations, (Write procedures that are clear and replicable. Identify observables and examine relationships between test (independent) variable and outcome (dependent) variable. Employ appropriate methods for accurate and consistent observations conduct and record measurements at appropriate levels of precision. Follow safety guidelines). Examine books and other sources of information to see what is already known, Review what is known in light of empirical evidence, (Examine whether available empirical evidence can be interpreted in terms of existing knowledge and models, and if not, modify or develop new models). Plan investigations, (Design and evaluate a scientific investigation). Use tools to gather, analyze, and interpret data (this includes the use of measurement in metric and other systems, and also the generation and interpretation of graphical representations of data, including data tables and graphs), (Collect data or evidence in an organized way. Properly use instruments, equipment, and materials (e.g., scales, probeware, meter sticks, microscopes, computers) including set-up, calibration, technique, maintenance, and storage). Pose answers, explanations, or descriptions of events, Generate explanations that explicate or describe natural phenomena (inferences), Use appropriate evidence and reasoning to justify these explanations to others, Communicate results of scientific investigations, and Evaluate the merits of the explanations produced by others.</p>
    <li><p>SC.912.N.1.2 Describe and explain what characterizes science and its methods.</p>
    <li><p>SC.912.N.1.4 Identify sources of information and assess their reliability according to the strict standards of scientific investigation.</p>
    <li><p>SC.912.N.1.5 Describe and provide examples of how similar investigations conducted in many parts of the world result in the same outcome.</p>
    <li><p>SC.912.N.1.6 Describe how scientific inferences are drawn from scientific observations and provide examples from the content being studied.</p>
    <li><p>SC.912.N.1.7 Recognize the role of creativity in constructing scientific questions, methods and explanations.</p>
    <li><p>SC.912.N.2.2 Identify which questions can be answered through science and which questions are outside the boundaries of scientific investigation, such as questions addressed by other ways of knowing, such as art, philosophy, and religion.</p>
    <li><p>SC.912.N.2.4 Explain that scientific knowledge is both durable and robust and open to change. Scientific knowledge can change because it is often examined and re-examined by new investigations and scientific argumentation. Because of these frequent examinations, scientific knowledge becomes stronger, leading to its durability.</p>
    <li><p>SC.912.N.2.5 Describe instances in which scientists' varied backgrounds, talents, interests, and goals influence the inferences and thus the explanations that they make about observations of natural phenomena and describe that competing interpretations (explanations) of scientists are a strength of science as they are a source of new, testable ideas that have the potential to add new evidence to support one or another of the explanations.</p>
    <li><p>SC.912.N.3.2 Describe the role consensus plays in the historical development of a theory in any one of the disciplines of science.</p>
    <li><p>SC.912.N.3.3 Explain that scientific laws are descriptions of specific relationships under given conditions in nature, but do not offer explanations for those relationships.</p>
    <li><p>SC.912.N.3.5 Describe the function of models in science, and identify the wide range of models used in science.</p>
    <li><p>SC.912.N.4.1 Explain how scientific knowledge and reasoning provide an empirically-based perspective to inform society's decision making.</p>
    <li><p>SC.912.P.10.1 Differentiate among the various forms of energy and recognize that they can be transformed from one form to others.</p>
    <li><p>SC.912.P.10.12 Differentiate between chemical and nuclear reactions. </p>
    <li><p>SC.912.P.10.18 Explore the theory of electromagnetism by comparing and contrasting the different parts of the electromagnetic spectrum in terms of wavelength, frequency, and energy, and relate them to phenomena and applications. </p>
    <li><p>SC.912.P.10.5 Relate temperature to the average molecular kinetic energy.</p>
    <li><p>SC.912.P.10.6 Create and interpret potential energy diagrams, for example: chemical reactions, orbits around a central body, motion of a pendulum.</p>
    <li><p>SC.912.P.10.7 Distinguish between endothermic and exothermic chemical processes.</p>
    <li><p>SC.912.P.10.9 Describe the quantization of energy at the atomic level.</p>
    <li><p>SC.912.P.12.10 Interpret the behavior of ideal gases in terms of kinetic molecular theory.</p>
    <li><p>SC.912.P.12.11 Describe phase transitions in terms of kinetic molecular theory.</p>
    <li><p>SC.912.P.12.12 Explain how various factors, such as concentration, temperature, and presence of a catalyst affect the rate of a chemical reaction.</p>
    <li><p>SC.912.P.12.13 Explain the concept of dynamic equilibrium in terms of reversible processes occurring at the same rates.</p>
    <li><p>SC.912.P.8.1 Differentiate among the four states of matter.</p>
    <li><p>SC.912.P.8.11 Relate acidity and basicity to hydronium and hydroxyl ion concentration and pH.</p>
    <li><p>SC.912.P.8.2 Differentiate between physical and chemical properties and physical and chemical changes of matter.</p>
    <li><p>SC.912.P.8.3 Explore the scientific theory of atoms (also known as atomic theory) by describing changes in the atomic model over time and why those changes were necessitated by experimental evidence.</p>
    <li><p>SC.912.P.8.4 Explore the scientific theory of atoms (also known as atomic theory) by describing the structure of atoms in terms of protons, neutrons and electrons, and differentiate among these particles in terms of their mass, electrical charges and locations within the atom.</p>
    <li><p>SC.912.P.8.5 Relate properties of atoms and their position in the periodic table to the arrangement of their electrons.</p>
    <li><p>SC.912.P.8.6 Distinguish between bonding forces holding compounds together and other attractive forces, including hydrogen bonding and van der Waals forces.</p>
