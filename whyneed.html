      <p>What is the importance of chemistry? Why would you want to learn about chemistry? Chemistry is the study of matter and its interactions with other matter and energy. Here's a look at the importance of chemistry and why you should study it.</p>
      <p>Chemistry   has a reputation for being a complicated and boring science, but for   the most part, that reputation is undeserved. Fireworks and explosions   are based on chemistry, so it's definitely not a boring science.   If you take classes in chemistry, you'll apply math and logic, which   can make studying chemistry a challenge if you are weak in those areas.   However, anyone can understand the basics of how things work... and   that's the study of chemistry. In a nutshell, the importance of   chemistry is that it explains the world around you. </p>

        <li> <strong>Cooking</strong><br>
          Chemistry explains how food changes   as you cook it, how it rots, how to preserve food, how your body uses   the food you eat, and how ingredients interact to make food.</li>
        <li> <strong>Cleaning</strong><br>
          Part of the importance of chemistry is it explains how cleaning works. You use chemistry to help decide   what cleaner is best for dishes, laundry, yourself, and your home. You   use chemistry when you use bleaches and disinfectants and even ordinary   soap and water. How do they work? That's chemistry!</li>
        <li> <strong>Medicine</strong><br>
          You   need to understand basic chemistry so you can understand how vitamins,   supplements, and drugs can help or harm you. Part of the importance of   chemistry lies in developing and testing new medical treatments and   medicines. </li>
        <li> <strong>Environmental Issues</strong><br>
          Chemistry   is at the heart of environmental issues. What makes one chemical a   nutrient and another chemical a pollutant? How can you clean up the   environment? What processes can produce the things you need without   harming the environment. </li>
        <li>Everyone can and should understand basic chemistry, but it may be important to take a course in chemistry or even make a career out of it. It's important to understand chemistry if you are studying any of the sciences because all of the sciences involve matter and the interactions between types of matter. Students wanting to become doctors, nurses, physicists, nutritionists, geologists, pharmacists, and (of course) chemists all study chemistry. You might want to make a career of chemistry because chemistry-related jobs are plentiful and high-paying. The importance of chemistry won't be diminished over time, so it will remain a promising career path.
